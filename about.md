The purpose of this site is to document my research in Cosmology done during my time at Stanford University under the guidance of astrophysicist [Roger Blandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Blandford). In particular, the project documented in this site explores methods of analyzing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) through innovative paramaterizations, as well as exploring methods of extracting information from the CMB to derive information about the structure of the entire universe.
