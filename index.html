  <h1>Welcome.</h1>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a low resolution map of the entire visible universe plus regions slightly outside of the horizon that can be evolved with time. The map will be created using the Cosmic Microwave Background as a constraint, and will allow the testing of some of the assumptions of inflationary theory that have not previously been verified, as well as serve as a prior for sky surveys when different sources of noise are being removed.</p>
